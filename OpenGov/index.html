                        <h2>About Us</h2>
                        <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society,
                            transparency is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the
                            heart of
                            how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at USA Open Gov we believe
                            that
                            government should be transparent.</p>
                        <p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public
                            business and spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This
                            transparency allows good and just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and
                            provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.</p>
                        <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the
                            Government's effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is
                            widely
                            dispersed in society, and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed
                            knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged in American
                            government.</p>
                        <p>USA Open Gov works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and
                            use. We solicit public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.

                        <h2>Background History of Government Transparency</h2>
                        <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible
                            to
                            public opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many
                            philosophes
                            made an attack on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their
                            intellectual
                            project.
                            The passage of formal legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this
                            time
                            with
                            Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory)
                            enacting free press legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act,
                            1766).
                            This approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent
                            historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.</p>
                        <p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789),
                            freedom of the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary
                            accounting
                            and freedom of the press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts
                            by
                            Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a
                            number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent
                            among
                            the latter.</p>
                        <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice
                            and is often linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian
                            countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the
                            origins
                            of its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the
                            presumption of
                            openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official
                            Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).</p>
                        <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                            Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
